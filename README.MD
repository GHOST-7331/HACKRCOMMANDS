# Hacker Command Cheat Sheet

Welcome to the Hacker Command Cheat Sheet! This repository is designed to serve as a comprehensive guide for penetration testers and security enthusiasts. It includes a wide array of commands useful for conducting various types of security assessments and network interactions. The cheat sheet covers everything from basic enumeration to advanced exploitation techniques.

## Acknowledgments

A majority of these commands have been gathered and refined from practical challenges and educational purposes provided by [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), an online platform to test and advance your skills in penetration testing and cyber security. Hack The Box offers a variety of scenarios for hands-on hacking experience, where I've had the chance to apply these commands in real-world simulations.

In addition to the resources provided by Hack The Box, this cheat sheet also includes unique findings and commands developed through my own research and practical experimentation. These contributions aim to enhance the depth and breadth of the tools and techniques available to the security community.

## Using This Cheat Sheet

The commands are categorized based on their application context:

- **Infrastructure-based Enumeration**: Focuses on network and service discovery.
- **Host-based Enumeration**: Delves into detailed enumeration techniques for specific hosts.

Each section is further divided based on the type of service (FTP, SMB, DNS, etc.), with the associated commands tailored for interacting with those specific services. Each command comes with a brief description for quick reference.
